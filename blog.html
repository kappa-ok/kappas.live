			<h2>Room For Two, In Depth.</h2>
			<img src="images/room42.png" alt="postimage">
			<p>The image over on the left is the self-titled peice Room For Two. The piece was created in Krita, which is my application of choice of digital art. The piece uses a style influenced by Keith Haring and a few other cartoonists. I made it as a test of a new brush type I downloaded, it's very simply about being kind and giving hope to the people around you. I think it's a pretty nice looking piece.</p>

			<h2>So What Is This Website?</h2>
			<p>
			This whole thing is made partially as a learning experience, and partially as a   portfolio site. I created it with the intention of showing my skill as a programmer, musician, artist, etc. to help with things like landing jobs. This blog was just another experiment for the site, but I find myself quite enjoying using it.
